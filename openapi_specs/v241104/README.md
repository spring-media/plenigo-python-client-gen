# Notes:
- changed the additionalData field to the proper type
- removed the enum info regarding AccessRightItemData -> itemType because it was missing fields like APP_STORE_PRODUCT, APP_STORE_SUBSCRIPTION, etc.
- corrected the AccessRightItemData -> data field to be a dictionary, instead of an array of dictionaries.
